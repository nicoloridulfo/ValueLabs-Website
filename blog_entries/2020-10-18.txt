Website launch!

After hours of work, the first version of the website has now been launched. <br><br>

Technical information:<br>
The website is made using python and the flask library. Since the website's content is static, 
the choice to host it using github pages was beneficial in many ways. The security implications 
of hosting a website are minimized, the hosting costs are none and it is way easier to deploy.
After the website is finished, using <a href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask">Frozen-Flask</a> it is frozen and pushed to the github repository.

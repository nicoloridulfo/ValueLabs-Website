# Valuelab website
This repo holds the website's files. It is composed by python, html, css, yml and regular text files.
The website can be run locally by executing the run.py file. To freeze the website the freeze.py is used. When the repo senses a push to the main branch a workflow is automatically triggered that build and deploys the website. The files that are directly hosted can be found in the gh-pages branch.
